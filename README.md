## **PROJET** 

Création d'un cluster EKS via Terraform

### How to setup ?

#### Initiate backend configuration

You need to create the backend configuration file (eg. config.s3.tfbackend) then you can run : `terraform init -backend-config="./config.s3.tfbackend"`

```tf
region = "<REGION>"
bucket= "<BUCKET_NAME>"
key = "<FILENAME>"
use_lockfile = <true / false>
```

### Plan deploy

```bash
terraform plan
```

### Apply deployment

```bash
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

## How to test EC2 instance ?

### SSH connection

A *key.pem* is generated by Terraform. You can use it to connect :

```bash
ssh -i "key.pem" ec2_user@<IP_PUB>
```

### Web service

We deployed a httpd service that we can access through a web browser by searching: 

```bash
http://<IP_PUB>
```

## Standardization

In a DevOps context, we may need to standardise our deployment workflow. That is why we set up a Makefile to ensure an assured workload.

### How to use Makefile ?

First, you need to initialize the Terraform project:

```bash
make init ARGS="<YOUR_BACKEND_CONFIG_FILE>"
```

To do a `terraform plan` use:

```bash
make plan
```

To do a `terraform apply` use:

```bash
make apply
```

To do a `terraform destroy` use:

```bash
make destroy
```
